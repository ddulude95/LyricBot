# LyricBot
Python script that fetches lyrics from azlyrics and posts it in a discord channel

I would text my buddy lyrics of songs we both liked almost every night. He said I should make a bot that would do it automatically...
Originally I was going to have it text him, but that was tricky to figure out. I ended up just turning it into a discord bot instead

This script uses a .env file to get my tokens.
